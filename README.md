- Hi, my name is Kelly and I am a math graduate student at Texas A&M University.
- I am living in Austin, TX and love exploring the city, trying new restaurants, and finding new places to hike/run
- My math interests are algebraic geometry and data science
- I’m currently learning JavaScript and continuing to work in Macaulay2 and Python so reach out if you want to code together!
- I'm also on the job market, so feel free to chat with me about available opportunities in data science.
